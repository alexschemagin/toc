~~The added integration of the Waypoints.js library enhances the usablity by compounding a smooth scrolling effect on body of the page.~~ The page now uses the customary CSS attribute smooth scroll-behavior instead of the external library, Waypoints, to get the smooth scrolling effect. Keen eyes will note I used the titles from 'Goodfellas' for headings/chapters here and the business ipsum generator for the filler text.
