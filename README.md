Automatic Table of Contents + Waypoints.js
==========================================

[Live demo](http://countereverything.com/github/toc/auto_toc.html)

Every heading will generate a list item in a dynamically-generated, fixed list.

The added integration of the Waypoints.js library enhances the usablity by compounding a smooth scrolling effect on body of the page. Keen eyes will note I used the titles from 'Goodfellas' for headings/chapters here and the business ipsum generator for the filler text.
